>## Fishing for Ice

**Purpose:** To observe the effects of salt on ice and hopefully succeed in fishing for ice too!

**Materials**

-container filled with water

-salt

-string/thread

-ice

**Procedures**
1. Pour ice cubs into the container filled with water.
2. Place string across an ice cub that you would like to pick up; it is recommended to get as much surface area touching as possible
3. Pour salt over where the string touches the ice, as if you are intending to "tape it" with ice
4. Wait for a few seconds, and then lift it up
5. If it doesn't work, don't worry. You can simply just try again while making sure to wait long enough and put enough salt.
6. To lift multiple ice cubes, simply lay the string over all the ice cubes that you would like to pick up, and then repeat the same procedure while pouring salt on all of them

**Explanation**

When salt is added to ice, the salt dissolves into the thin layer of water on the ice, lowering the melting point. Because the melting point lowers, the ice cube begins to melt, creating more liquid. This water combines with the salt water solution, effectively diluting it and raising the melting point again. The result of this is the resolidification of ice, where the melted water around the string turns back into ice. With this, the string is trapped in the ice, which is why we are able to lift it up and basically "fish" for ice. This experiment actually uses the same logic that is used in pouring salt on an icy sidewalk to melt it, where the salt is able to lower its melting point and cause it to turn into water.



>## Bottle Rocket

**Purpose:** To build and launch a rocket powered by water!

**Materials**

-cardboard

-hammer

-nail (1 inch or longer)

-tape

-electrical tape

-scissors

-cork

-ruler

-bike pump with inflation needle

-plastic water bottle (half-full of water)

**Procedures**
1. Take the cork and trim it down to 3 cm long
2. Take electrical tape and wrap it around the cork five times (add one or two more if the cork does not fit snugly into the plastic water bottle)
3. Hammer the nail through the cork to create a hole
4. Cut the cardboard into triangles that are 15 cm by 5 cm
5. Take the construction paper and wrap it around the bottle; tape it on securely
6. For the cone, cut a semicircle with about a 7 cm radius
7. Cut a line from the flat side that extends a few centimeters into the semicircle
8. fold the semicircle into a cone shape, and tape it together
9. Tape the cone onto the bottom of the water bottle (the water bottle should be launched while being upside down)
10. Attach all four cardboard triangles as fins for the rocket using tape
11. Make sure to have the bottom of the fins about 7 cm below the bottom of the upside down water bottle
12. To launch, remove the bottle cap from the rocket
13. Insert the inflation needle into the hole in the cork
14. Push the cork into the opening of the water bottle, making sure that no water leaks out
15. Using the bike pump that attaches to the inflation needle, pump air into the rocket and watch it shoot out into the sky!
