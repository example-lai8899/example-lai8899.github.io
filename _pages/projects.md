>## Fishing for Ice

**Purpose:** To observe the effects of salt on ice and hopefully succeed in fishing for ice too!

**Materials:**

-container filled with water

-salt

-string/thread

-ice

**Procedures**
1. Pour ice cubs into the container filled with water.
2. Place string across an ice cub that you would like to pick up; it is recommended to get as much surface area touching as possible
3. Pour salt over where the string touches the ice, as if you are intending to "tape it" with ice
4. Wait for a few seconds, and then lift it up
5. If it doesn't work, don't worry. You can simply just try again while making sure to wait long enough and put enough salt.
6. To lift multiple ice cubes, simply lay the string over all the ice cubes that you would like to pick up, and then repeat the same procedure while pouring salt on all of them

**Explanation**

When salt is added to ice, the salt dissolves into the thin layer of water on the ice, lowering the melting point. Because the melting point lowers, the ice cube begins to melt, creating more liquid. This water combines with the salt water solution, effectively diluting it and raising the melting point again. The result of this is the resolidification of ice, where the melted water around the string turns back into ice. With this, the string is trapped in the ice, which is why we are able to lift it up and basically "fish" for ice. This experiment actually uses the same logic that is used in pouring salt on an icy sidewalk to melt it, where the salt is able to lower its melting point and cause it to turn into water.
